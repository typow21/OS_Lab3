## Over view
This program is designed to allow one server connect to multiple computers and allow them to check spelling of words. The server responds after each request with an answer whether the word is spelled right or now. The spellchecker can only take one word from each user at a time. This program utilizes multi-threading to ensure that everything runs accurately and efficiently.
